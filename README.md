# Introduction

This study aims to investigate the relationship between the price of a product sold on Amazon, and its rating. The results from this study will be used to drive design decisions for what types of products businesses on Amazon should release in order to leave consumers satisfied with both price and condition/usefulness/durability of a product.

1. Which categories have the best selling Amazon products?
- This question is asked in order to find out which categories have the highest number of sales and best-selling products (denoted by a boolean).This question is important because we want to find out which categories have a lot of sales first, so we can compare ratings and their prices within each category to narrow our research scope.

2. Which Amazon product(s) have the most sales?
- This question is asked in order to find which Amazon products overall have the highest number of sales. This question is important because after finding the categories with the best selling Amazon products, we want to find individual products in order to research them specifically and read reviews to connect them to the rating the reviewer gave.

3. How are ratings of a product on Amazon correlated with the price of the product?
- This question is asked as our main research question. This question is important because we want to investigate the products where the price of an item where it is cheap enough to satisfy consumers, yet also good enough to encourage the customer to leave a good review, in order to give insights for businesses on Amazon on how they should design their products to reach this balance point between price and satisfaction.
